# Palindrome Checking

## Kate Folkenroth

## Program Output

### Use four fenced code blocks to provide output from four different runs of `palindromechecker` with different inputs

- **Recursive:**
  - *Input `level` is a palindrome*
  `poetry run palindromechecker --word level --approach recursive`
  
  ```
  âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

  ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "level" is a palindrome!

  ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
  ```

  - *Input `hello` is not a palindrome*
  `poetry run palindromechecker --word hello --approach recursive`

  ```
  âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

  ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "hello" is a palindrome!

  ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? No, it is not!
  ```

- **Reverse:**
  - *Input `level` is a palindrome*
  `poetry run palindromechecker --word level --approach reverse`

  ```
  âœ¨ Awesome, using the reverse approach for palindrome checking!

  ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "level" is a palindrome!

  ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
  ```

  - *Input `hello` is not a palindrome*
  `poetry run palindromechecker --word hello --approach reverse`

  ```
  âœ¨ Awesome, using the reverse approach for palindrome checking!

  ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "hello" is a palindrome!

  ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? No, it is not!
  ```

### What is the output from running the test suite with test coverage monitoring?

`poetry run task coverage`

```

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### An example of a test case for the command-line interface of the `palindromechecker`

```
def test_palindromechecker_recursive_is_palindrome():
    """Ensure that the command-line interface works for recursive approach."""
    result = runner.invoke(
        cli, ["--word", "civic", "--approach", "recursive"]
    )
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "recursive" in result.stdout
    assert "reverse" not in result.stdout
    assert "Yes, it is!" in result.stdout
    assert "civic" in result.stdout
```

#### An example of a test case for the `util` module of the `palindromechecker`

```
def test_human_readable_boolean_true():
    """Ensure that a human-readable true boolean works correctly."""
    true_value = True
    true_value_human_readable = util.get_human_readable_boolean(true_value)

#### An example of a test case for the `palindrome` module of the `palindromechecker`

```

    word = "civic"
    result = palindrome.is_palindrome_recursive(word)
    assert result is True
